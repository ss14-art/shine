# SS14 Chemistry

## Rules

- Put new Shine chemistry prototypes under `Resources/Prototypes/_sh`.
- Keep reagent/reaction/metabolism behavior data-driven.
- Use existing solution container APIs.
- Be careful with predicted code that resolves solution entities leaving PVS.
- Localize reagent names, examine text, UI, and feedback.
- Avoid hardcoding reagent IDs in systems when `ProtoId<ReagentPrototype>` or prototype data can be used.

## Bundled References

- `references/reagent-reaction-solution.md`: reagent, reaction, metabolism, and solution-container modeling checks.
