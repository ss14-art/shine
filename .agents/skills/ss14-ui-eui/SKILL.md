# SS14 UI EUI

## Use EUI When

- The UI is admin/server-service oriented.
- It does not belong to a specific in-world entity.
- Server authority and permissions are central to the workflow.

## Rules

- Validate permissions server-side for every action.
- Keep state minimal and explicit.
- Localize visible strings.
- Avoid using EUI for normal entity-bound gameplay; use BUI for that.
- Keep client presentation in `Content.Client/_sh` and authority in `Content.Server/_sh`.

## Review

Check for authorization, spoofed messages, stale state, and leaks of sensitive data.

## Bundled References
