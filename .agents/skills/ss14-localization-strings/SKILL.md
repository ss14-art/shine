# SS14 Localization Strings

FTL is gameplay-facing API. Name it and structure it carefully.

## Workflow

1. Open `references/localization-policy.md`.
2. Open `references/ftl-naming-and-layout.md`.
3. Open `references/selectors-and-entity-args.md` for dynamic grammar.
4. Open example refs for prototypes and markings.

## Rules

- Use kebab-case, subsystem-scoped IDs.
- Put Shine strings under `Resources/Locale/en-US/_sh`.
- Use variables/selectors/functions instead of prebuilt English sentences in code.
