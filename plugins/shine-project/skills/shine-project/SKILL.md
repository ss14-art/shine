# Shine Project Plugin Bridge

This plugin is an adapter. The canonical source of truth is in the repository:

- `.agents/rules/`
- `.agents/skills/`
- root and subtree `AGENTS.md`

Before coding, load `.agents/skills/shine-project/SKILL.md`, then follow `.agents/rules/shine-hard-guardrails.md` and `.agents/rules/ss14-skill-preflight-and-refresh.md`.

Never treat this bridge as the canon. If the bridge conflicts with `.agents`, `.agents` wins.
